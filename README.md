**üïπÔ∏è About the Game:**
This addictive game offers three challenging modes: easy, medium, and hard. You'll have three chances to find the word, but don't worry if you miss out - you can reshuffle the board and try again! Plus, keep an eye out for the game result component and toast notifications to stay updated on your progress.

**üõ†Ô∏è Why Aura Component?**
I chose to build this game using Aura Component because many old applications and big firms are still utilizing this technology. I wanted to dive into Aura and showcase my skills while catering to a wide audience. However, stay tuned because my next target is to develop a version of this game using Lightning Web Components (LWC)!

**üõ†Ô∏è How to Use the Component:**
1. Download the code from my GitHub repository.
2. Push it to your Salesforce org.
3. Choose any Salesforce app.
4. Click on "Edit Page."
5. Select "Add Custom Component."
6. Add both the board panel and result component.
7. Click "Save" and then refresh the page.
8. Get ready to enjoy the game!
